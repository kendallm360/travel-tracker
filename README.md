# Travel Tracker

Travel Tracker is the final solo project built during Mod 2 of Turing School of Software and Design. This project focused on using TDD and OOP to build an interactive travel site where users can log in to view past/upcoming trips as well as book new trips. Specifications for this project can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/travel-tracker.html).

## Goals
- Use OOP to drive the design of the application and the code
- Work with an API to send and receive data
- Solidify the code review process
- Create a robust test suite that thoroughly tests all functionality of a client-side application

## Steps to Run the Site
1. Clone this repo down to your machine
2. Clone the server to the API repo [here](https://github.com/turingschool-examples/travel-tracker-api)
3. Open the root directory for each repo and run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm start` in each repo to initialize the webpage and web server
5. Open the site by copying and pasting the server location http://localhost:8080/ in your address bar

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- VSCODE
- Webpack
- Mocha & Chai
- Lighthouse
- Wave 
- Taba11y
- Postman

## Challenges
- Getting the user's newly booked trips to show in the pending tab without refreshing the page
- Creating the calculation functions and deciding how to break them up for better SRP

## Wins
- Realizing I can accomplish a lot by myself
- Using separate files like mockData, utils, and domUpdates to break up logic for better SRP

## Future Additions
- Add local storage to save requested trips
- Add functionality to log in as a travel agent in order to approve or deny trips booked by the user
